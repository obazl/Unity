Bazel example
=============

Same as example 4, but uses a unity_config.h file.

expected fail: //examples/bazel/test/test_runners:1

Test1 and test2 are copied from one of the other examples, but configured for Bazel.

Unity_config_h demonstrates use of `unity_library` macro to pass `unity_config.h`.
